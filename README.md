# Lab 0: Linked list in C Programming

This first lab assignment is for aimed to give you a heads up on the
low-level semantics of the C programming language that you will be using
throught this course.

For this lab, your task is to fill in the skeleton code and implement the doubly linked list.
You will need to dynamically allocate memory for new nodes using the `malloc()` function, and free any deleted nodes using the `free()` function.

You can access the reference for the two functions using the following commands:

```
$ man malloc
$ man free
```
